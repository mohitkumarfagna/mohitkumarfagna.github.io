                <h3>Why</h3>
                <h4>Why the name momentum march?</h4>
                <p>It doesn't matter, but if you just wanna know, read on. It is named so because in the month of march you gain a momentum in the direction of your goal. Momentum here refers to the confidence, dedication and belief that you are going to make it. These are the things that carry you even when external forces are not in your favor.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Decide on a realistic goal.</h4>
                        <p>I want a fit body. I want to wake up on time everyday. I want to be able to draw portraits. I want to learn how to swim, dance, sing, code, draw, write or speak better. I want to have a better sense of humor. I want better grades. I want to be confident. I want to understand how advertisements, movies, spaceships or ants work. I want to do handstands, headstands, push ups or a really complex yoga pose.</p>
                        <p>Don't get crazy, just pick one. It just shouldn't sound like I want to swallow kids. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Find a mentor</h4>
                        <p>If you think you don't need one, you most of all need one. Look for people who take an interest in your goal. There are hidden gems all around us. Just keep digging a little bit everyday until you find one. There's no trick here, just go out and ask people. You don't have to be impressive or something.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Prepare</h4>
                        <p>Do some research, find out the basic deal about your goal. Set a path. It's not going to be a clear path. If it looks clear, something is wrong. Either you are delusional, over confident or you've picked a goal you've already achieved. Anyways, you'll figure it out during the exercise.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Expect Nothing</h4>
                        <p>Not really a step but a necessary thing above all. This has been said in various forms such as. Take your mind off it. Don't think about it. Just do it. But it's always a trippy business for people who don't understand how to expect nothing. Here's how: Expect reality. Know that people are not known for what they achieved in a month. Also, remember that it is a begining. It is done to understand so you'll understand better at the end of it rather than before even doing it. Do whatever it takes to remember this. Maybe put a weekly reminder for a month that reminds you of what to expect.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>So you know the theory, now go ahead and get to work or tell a friend who you think might be in a need of this.</p>
